### About
-----
Tracker is desktop task tracker with very small functionality.
It is my university work. Nothing special.
My personal objective was to make a first step to desktop graphic interfaces development and to try it with Tkinter.

Tracker is written in Python 2.7 using only standard Python libraries. 

##### Key libraries:
- Tkinter
- SQLite3

##### Why Tkinter?
Because that's cross-platform powerful library that included in standard Python package.

##### Functionality:
- user registration
- ability to create task and assign it to any Tracker user
