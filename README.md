### About
-----
Tracker is desktop task tracker with very small functionality.
It is my university work. Nothing special.
My personal objective was to make a first step to desktop graphic interfaces development and to try it with Tkinter.

Tracker is written in Python 2.7 using only standard Python libraries. 

##### Key libraries:
- Tkinter
- SQLite3

##### Why Tkinter?
Because that's cross-platform powerful library that's included in standard Python package.

##### Functionality:
- user registration
- ability to create task and assign it to any Tracker user

##### How to run Tracker:
If you have Python installed in your system just go to the directory where Tracker located and execute the following command from console:

```python run.py```


```Python 2.7``` is already installed on MacOS X, Ubuntu and some other Linuxes.
On Windows you have to install ```Python 2.7```. You can get in from the official site: https://www.python.org/<br>
Don't forget to add Python to ```PATH``` environmental variable (there's an option in Python installer)
